Introduction to GitHub - code sharing makes easier;
Github account is considered as remote and our machine as local.
From the local project directory; type git remote: to check whether it connected to any git hub repo's or not
if adding a first repo; then git remote add origin giturl; otherwise, we need to replace origin with remote reponame
once remote is established, you can push the changes, using git push origin master
