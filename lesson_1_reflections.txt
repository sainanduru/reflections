Lesson 1:

It is about GIT and Github;
Why we should use and how we should use these two.
GIT is a version control software and GITHUB is a code sharing/collaboration workspace.
In lesson 1, i have downloaded game_new.js and game_old.js files then used fc command to find the differences in a huge files.
Note: Windows command prompt has an inbuilt fileCompare mechanism and it is accessed by fc game_old.js game_new.js
Note: Mac terminal has an inbuilt command called diff and it is used as diff -u game_old.js game_new.js
I have learned about assigning alias to sublime to invoke it from gitbash directly

echo 'alias subl="C:/Program\ Files/Sublime\ Text\ 2/sublime_text.exe"' >> ~/.bashrc

and also learned about creating folders/directories.

cd ~                          # change directories to your home directory
mkdir version-control         # make version-control directory
cd version-control            # go to version-control directory
mkdir reflections             # create reflections directory
cd reflections                # go to reflections directory
subl lesson_1_reflections.txt # launch sublime with file called lesson_1_reflections.txt (you can replace subl with another editor here if you prefer a different one)

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

git log (*Author, date, message),
type-of, part-of, operates on

manual commits;

too-big - more wait time to commit or more lines of code : not advisable
too-small - commit for any small change : not advisable
just-right - commit any logical change : advisable


git log --stat

git allows saving multiple file sin a single commit as it provides flexibility to commit inter-related files at a same time thereby avoid any mistakes 

git clone urltoclone

we can use gitlog and git diff commands.
gitlog - It is used to view the log of commits under the parent directory. To scroll down, press the down arrow key
git diff commitid1 commitid2 - it gives the difference between 2 commits

if we want to go back to working copy of the version, then we have to use checkout. Checkout in GIT refers to going to previous version. However, we will see a message called DETACH HEAD as we moved over to the previous commit that the present commit and made it as an active one.

git checkout commitID

have set default editor to sublime..used alias as subl in bash_profile.
